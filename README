#Interact 2025 Paper Submission Files

This repository was established to share files associated with our paper submission for **Interact 2025**.

##Repository Contents

- **Questionnaires**  
  The repository contains the questionnaires used in our study. These were originally administered to participants through a **web-based interface**. However, converting them to **PDF format** resulted in the loss of their original formatting.

- **Results**  
  The results are available in an **Excel file**, which consists of a single worksheet summarizing the data collected from the administered questionnaires.

## âš Important Notes

- **Automatic Translation**  
  Both the questionnaires and the results were **automatically translated**, so some translation errors may be present.

- **Anonymity Considerations**  
  The original files are not included to ensure the anonymity of the country of origin.
